The beginnings of awesome.

*We're underway!*

Currently there is just an HTML page that executes a GET request and displays the results. The GET is from a static json file (which will be replaced by a Django API server).

In order to see the web page:

1. Make sure python is in your system's PATH variable
2. Launch server.bat, which is a simple server running only on your computer. (This will be replaced by a Django HTML server.)
3. Go to http://localhost:8000/index.html in a web browser
