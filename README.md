Project Statler is an online system that allows playgoers to review plays from *Ten! Ten! Ten!*, a production by the George Fox University theater department. The website uses sentiment analysis to automatically rank plays according to the sentiments users express in their reviews.

The finished site is now available at [tententenreviews.com](http://tententenreviews.com).

See [the Wiki](https://github.com/GFUCABAM/statler/wiki) for a complete description of the project's goals.
